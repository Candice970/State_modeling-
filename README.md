# Integration & Traceability
- Diagrams align with FRs from Assignment 4 and user stories from Assignment 6.
- Each diagram includes functional requirement mapping in explanations.

# Comparison:
- State diagrams focus on object behavior – useful for understanding lifecycle.
- Activity diagrams highlight process flow – better for describing user/system interaction.
